# Lord of the Rings LCG Helper

I've been revently playing a lot of [Lord of the Rings living card game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/). At some point I realised that a helper application that would keep track of threat level, active player, which turn is it etc. would be handy. I decided to make it my side project.
This is also my first Vue.js project.

[Demo](http://armitage.vdl.pl/lotr/index.html)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification

```
