# Threat Tracker for the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game

I've been revently playing a lot of [the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/). At some point I realised that a helper application that would keep track of threat level, active player and that could count turns would be handy. I decided to make it my side project.
This is also my first Vue.js project.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```
